# Stakeholder Analysis Template

Plot each stakeholder by two axes:
- **Impacted by Issue** (Low → High)
- **Can Impact Issue** (Low → High)

## Quadrant Guide
- **High Impacted / High Influence** – Co-creators and core partners.
- **High Impacted / Low Influence** – Center their lived experience; plan empowerment tactics.
- **Low Impacted / High Influence** – Potential champions; brief with clear asks.
- **Low Impacted / Low Influence** – Monitor occasionally.

## Matrix (sample fields)
| Stakeholder | Impacted (1-5) | Influence (1-5) | Current stance | Engagement plan |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
|             |                |                 |                |                  |
|             |                |                 |                |                  |
|             |                |                 |                |                  |
