# Stakeholder Analysis Example – Clean Air Now Campaign

## Scenario
Student organizers are pushing a city council clean-trucking ordinance that would reduce diesel pollution near two public schools. Key stakeholders:

| Stakeholder | Impacted (1-5) | Influence (1-5) | Current stance | Engagement plan |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Parents at Riverdale Elementary | 5 | 2 | Highly supportive but not yet organized | Host listening session + recruit storytellers (Q2) |
| City Council President Ortega | 3 | 5 | Persuadable, wants economic data | Present health + jobs briefings, line up business allies (Q4) |
| Logistics Association | 2 | 4 | Opposed | Map internal champions, offer phased timeline (Q4) |
| School Nurses Union | 4 | 3 | Supportive | Invite to testify, co-write op-ed (Q1) |
| Port Authority | 1 | 4 | Neutral | Share study showing long-term savings (Q4) |
| Youth Climate Collective | 5 | 3 | Supportive | Co-lead rallies + digital storytelling (Q1) |
| Neighborhood Business Alliance | 2 | 2 | Mixed | Brief them with incentives (Q3) |

## Chart Placement
```
High Impacted ↑

| School Nurses (Q1) | Council President / Logistics / Port (Q4) |
| Parents / Youth (Q2 & Q1) | Business Alliance (Q3) |

               → High Influence
```

## Insights
- Need to elevate parent + youth voices (Q1/Q2) to sway high-influence targets.
- Engage School Nurses Union early to validate health data.
- Craft economic briefs for Council + business groups.
