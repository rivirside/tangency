# Volunteer Shift Script

## Opening Huddle
- Welcome team, remind everyone of values (solidarity, consent, no surveillance).
- Review safety info (restrooms, shade, emergency contact).
- Assign roles: intake, sorting, hosts, floaters, story collector.

## Intake Flow
1. Greet donor: “Thanks for being here! Can you let me know what you’re dropping off?”
2. Log items on the intake sheet / spreadsheet.
3. Direct them to feedback wall if they want to share why they give.

## Host Script for Neighbors
“Hi! This is a free community shop. Take what keeps you safe today. Need something not on the table? We can note it.”

## Closing Checklist
- Count remaining items and log in tracker.
- Wipe tables, sort trash/recycling.
- Share top requests with comms lead.
