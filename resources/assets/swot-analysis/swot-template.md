# Impact Project SWOT Template

Use this grid to connect strengths and weaknesses (internal) with opportunities and threats (external).

| Strengths (Internal) | Weaknesses (Internal) |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
|                      |                       |
|                      |                       |
|                      |                       |

| Opportunities (External) | Threats (External) |
|--------------------------|--------------------|
|                          |                    |
|                          |                    |
|                          |                    |

## Prompt Questions
- Strengths: What assets, skills, or credibility do we already have?
- Weaknesses: Where are the gaps in capacity, funding, coordination?
- Opportunities: What funding cycles, policy windows, or partnerships are emerging?
- Threats: What opponents, regulations, or resource cliffs could block us?

## Next Steps
1. Brainstorm individually, then fill sticky notes in each quadrant.
2. Cluster themes and prioritize top 2 per box.
3. Convert each quadrant into actions (e.g., match strengths to opportunities).
