# SWOT Example – Community Fridge Expansion

## Context
Neighborhood mutual-aid group wants to expand from one community fridge to three locations.

### Strengths
- Trusted volunteers already running fridge #1
- Existing donations from local grocer
- Strong social media engagement

### Weaknesses
- Limited cold-chain equipment
- Volunteer burnout on maintenance
- No formal agreement with property owners

### Opportunities
- City micro-grant for healthy food pilots
- Partnership with culinary school willing to prep meals
- Media interest in mutual-aid stories this summer

### Threats
- Rising utility costs
- Vandalism at new sites
- Health department inspections tightening

## Insights
- Pair strength (grocer donations) with opportunity (city grant) to fund better refrigeration.
- Address weakness (no property agreements) to mitigate threat (inspections/vandalism) by drafting MOUs.
- Recruit culinary school interns to relieve volunteer burnout.
