# Press Day Toolkit

_A Tangency Action Kit_

## Snapshot
- **Focus:** Media Outreach
- **Format:** Template Pack
- **Time:** Half-day build
- **Ideal team:** Communications crew + spokespeople
- **Great for:** Report launches, executive actions, investigation responses
- **Deliverable:** Media advisory, press list, b-roll folder, quote bank
- **Materials:** Shared drive, bios, embargo schedule

## Prep checklist
1. Draft a two-paragraph advisory with headline, hook, and spokespeople.
2. Package assets (photos, logos, b-roll) in one folder with clear filenames.
3. Identify three validators (partners, academics, workers) for quotes.
4. Decide which outlets get embargoed previews and schedule briefings.

## Timeline
1. **T-24 hours.** Send embargoed advisory to key reporters and offer background calls.
2. **T-3 hours.** Distribute public advisory + asset folder to the full list; post teaser graphics.
3. **Go live.** Release the report/action, flood every channel, and pitch tailored follow-ups.
4. **Post-release.** Track coverage, post clips, and send thank-yous plus “what’s next.”

## Tips
- Assign one person to manage the war-room inbox for rapid replies.
- Prep social proof (ally quotes, infographics) to drop as soon as coverage lands.
- Maintain a coverage tracker with open rates, replies, and sentiment.
