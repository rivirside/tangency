# Narrative Sprint Board

_A Tangency Action Kit_

## Snapshot
- **Focus:** Communications
- **Format:** Sprint Template
- **Time:** 60-minute kickoff + async updates
- **Ideal team:** Comms lead plus channel owners
- **Great for:** Launch weeks, report drops, rapid-response overlaps
- **Deliverable:** Shared Kanban/spreadsheet tracking every post, pitch, and email
- **Materials:** Project board (Trello/Airtable/Notion), asset folder, approval matrix

## Core idea
Pick one anchor message, two proof points, and one call to action. Every row on the sprint board must ladder back to those pillars so your story stays cohesive no matter how chaotic the news cycle becomes.

## Prep checklist
1. Create the sprint board with columns such as Idea → Drafting → Review → Scheduled → Live.
2. List every owned or partner channel (email, SMS, Instagram, TikTok, press list, podcast, etc.).
3. Gather photography, stats, quotes, and design files in one shared folder.
4. Confirm who approves copy, graphics, and spokesperson bookings.

## Sprint flow
1. **Kickoff (Day 0, 60 min).** Walk through the message brief, assign owners to each channel, time-box production windows.
2. **Async stand-ups (Daily, 10 min).** Use Slack threads or Loom updates for blockers and wins; only meet live if multiple pieces stall.
3. **Amplify proof (Mid-week).** Share early analytics so the team doubles down on resonating content; remix hits for slower channels.
4. **Close + retro (End of week, 30 min).** Capture what worked, what flopped, and templates you’ll reuse. Export the board for documentation.

## Tips
- Pin key talking points at the top of each card so editors stay on message.
- Store captions, graphics, and alt text inside the card for future reuse.
- Track UTM links or custom codes so you can link conversions back to the sprint.

## Tools & templates
- One-week sprint board (CSV + Airtable base)
- Messaging brief doc
- Retro worksheet
