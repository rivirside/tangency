# Healing Circle Routine

_A Tangency Action Kit_

## Snapshot
- **Focus:** Wellbeing
- **Format:** Facilitation Guide
- **Time:** 30–45 minutes
- **Ideal team:** Any size
- **Great for:** Post-action debriefs, campaign pivots, tough news cycles
- **Deliverable:** Agreements, anonymized themes, support commitments
- **Materials:** Timer, talking piece, shared notes doc, optional virtual whiteboard

## Prep checklist
1. Choose a facilitator and note-taker (rotate each session).
2. Prepare an opening grounding practice (breath, stretch, music, visualization).
3. Set up a doc to capture themes and follow-ups.

## Flow
1. **Welcome & agreements (5 min).** Review confidentiality, step up/step back, care options.
2. **Grounding (5 min).** Guide a short somatic or breathing practice.
3. **Shares (20–25 min).** Each person offers one high, one low, one request for support using a talking piece or digital queue.
4. **Collective decisions (10 min).** Identify what to pause, delegate, or resource differently based on what surfaced.
5. **Close (5 min).** Appreciate the group and remind everyone of available support (therapy funds, rest days, etc.).

## Tips
- Rotate facilitators so care work is shared.
- Offer multiple ways to participate (voice, chat, doc).
- Summarize anonymized themes for leadership so structural changes follow.

## Tools & templates
- Circle agenda + script
- Support request tracker
- Follow-up email template with resourcing decisions
