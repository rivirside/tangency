## Prep checklist
1. Gather the bill summary, fiscal note, and opposition talking points.

## Studio flow
1. **Outline (15 min).** Write the human-centered lead: problem, people affected, proposed fix.
2. **Break it down (20 min).** Create three sections—what the bill does, how it’s paid for, what happens if it fails—using bullets/icons.
3. **Add story + CTA (15 min).** Drop in a quote or mini case study and a QR code linking to deeper resources or action forms.
4. **Peer review (15 min).** Policy lead checks accuracy; organizers ensure clarity for everyday readers.
5. **Publish (10 min).** Export PDF for print and PNG for digital sharing.
