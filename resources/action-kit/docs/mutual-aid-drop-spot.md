## Prep checklist
1. Secure a location with shade or indoor access, restrooms, and transit.
2. Obtain property or city approval if needed.
3. Create signage for “Intake,” “Sorting,” and “Free Store.”
4. Set up a QR survey or clipboard to capture requests and feedback.

## Operating guide
1. **Intake.** Greeters welcome donors, record items, and note dates for food.
2. **Sorting.** Volunteers inspect, wipe, and categorize (pantry, hygiene, baby, PPE, etc.).
3. **Community shopping.** Display items neatly, offer tote bags, and let neighbors choose what they need. Set limits only if inventory is low.
4. **Wrap-up.** Document leftovers, redistribute perishables, and share priority requests on social or newsletters.

## Care tips
- Post mutual aid values (solidarity not charity, no questions asked).
- Provide stipends or gift cards for directly impacted volunteers.
- Partner with local businesses for recurring donations of high-need items.
