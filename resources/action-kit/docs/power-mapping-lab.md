## Why this lab matters
Without a power map, teams end up guessing where to aim tactics. This session slows everyone down long enough to agree on the specific person with authority to grant your demand, the people whispering in their ear, and which allies are underutilized. The final artifact becomes your campaign’s north star.

## Prep checklist
1. Invite a diverse mix of staff, volunteers, and directly impacted members.
2. Collect any research you already have on decision-makers or corporate structure.
3. Print or duplicate the Tangency Power Map canvas so participants can add notes quickly.
4. Assign a facilitator, timekeeper, note-taker, and photographer before the meeting begins.

## Agenda
1. **Frame the win (10 min).** Share the crisp demand, deadline, and what victory unlocks. Ask participants to name the one person who can say yes.
2. **Map the primary + secondary targets (25 min).** Place the primary decision-maker in the center. Brainstorm every person or institution that influences them—funders, customers, associations—placing them closer or further based on relationship strength.
3. **Layer allies, opponents, neutrals (20 min).** Add organizations, community leaders, and internal champions. Mark allies with green, opponents with red, undecided targets with yellow.
4. **Assign ownership (20 min).** For each influential node, decide who will research, cultivate, or pressure them. Capture assignments on a shared tracker before the session ends.
5. **Close with next steps (15 min).** Summarize insights, schedule follow-up touchpoints, and photograph the map from multiple angles. Share files within 24 hours.

## Facilitator tips
- Keep people standing or moving to encourage bold brainstorming.
- Push for specificity—“City Council” is vague; “Council President Ortega” is actionable.
- Convert the map into a living digital diagram so distant teammates can contribute.
