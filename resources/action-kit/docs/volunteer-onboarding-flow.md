# Volunteer Onboarding Flow

_A Tangency Action Kit_

## Snapshot
- **Focus:** Organizing Operations
- **Format:** Workflow
- **Time:** Build once, automate
- **Ideal team:** Operations + team leads
- **Great for:** Rapid scaling, fellowship launches, distributed chapters
- **Deliverable:** Automated journey map + task assignments
- **Materials:** Email platform, calendar tool, intake survey, buddy roster

## Flow overview
Three touch points—instant welcome email, orientation session, and first assignment with a buddy check-in—move supporters from sign-up to action within five days. Track conversions between each stage to improve scripts.

## Prep checklist
1. Write a welcome email naming two immediate roles people can take.
2. Create an intake survey capturing skills, schedule, and languages.
3. Block recurring 30-minute orientation sessions.
4. Recruit a “buddy bench” of experienced volunteers willing to shadow newcomers.

## Implementation
1. **Day 0 – Email.** Auto-send the welcome note with intake survey + Calendly link.
2. **Day 2 – Orientation.** Cover mission, campaigns, culture norms, and end with a menu of starter tasks. Get every attendee to choose one live.
3. **Day 3 – Assignment.** Team leads receive the survey + task choice and send a direct intro to the buddy and project lead.
4. **Day 5 – Buddy check-in.** Buddies confirm progress, troubleshoot, and log blockers in the onboarding tracker.

## Tips
- Measure conversion: first-task completions ÷ total sign-ups.
- Record a 5-minute orientation video for people who miss the live session.
- Celebrate Day 5 wins publicly to reinforce rapid action.
